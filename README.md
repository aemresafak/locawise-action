## Features

- 🚀 **Automated & Effortless**: Set it up once, and Locawise handles new translations whenever you push to your main branch. No more manual tracking or tedious copy-pasting!
- 🧠 **Context-Aware AI Translations**: Powered by OpenAI (GPT models) and Google Vertex AI (Gemini models), Locawise understands your application's context, glossary, and desired tone, delivering translations that are not just accurate but appropriate.
- 💰 **Cost-Effective**: Only new or changed text gets translated. Choose an efficient LLM provider like Gemini, and your costs can be close to zero!
- ⏱️ **Lightning Fast**: Localize thousands of keys in under a minute. Your time is valuable; spend it on coding, not translating.
- 🛠️ **Developer-Friendly**: Simple YAML configuration (i18n.yaml is generated by the action) lets you define everything from language codes to specific terminology directly in your workflow file.
- 🔄 **Respects Your Edits**: Manually refined a translation? Locawise's i18n.lock file ensures your specific changes are preserved and only new or source-language modifications trigger AI translation.
- 🔗 **Flexible LLM Choice**: Pick your preferred LLM provider and model.
- 💪 **Built-in Resilience**: Temporary LLM provider hiccups? Locawise implements exponential random backoff retries to overcome TPM (Tokens Per Minute) limits.
- 📂 **Supports Your Format**: Currently supports .json and .properties files, with more formats on the way!

## How It Works

The locawise-action leverages the locawise Python package.

1. It checks out your repository.
2. Sets up Python and installs locawise.
3. Dynamically creates an i18n.yaml configuration file based on your workflow inputs.
4. Runs locawise to:
   - Identify changes in your source language file using an i18n.lock file.
   - Translate only the new or modified keys into your target languages using the specified LLM, context, and glossary.
   - Update your target language files.
5. Commits the changes and creates a pull request for your review.

```

### Add Secrets

- **OpenAI**: If using OpenAI, add your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your repository's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
- **Vertex AI**: If using Google Vertex AI:
  1. Create a Google Cloud service account with the "Vertex AI User" role (or more granular permissions as needed).
  2. Download the JSON key file for this service account.
  3. **IMPORTANT**: You MUST Base64 encode the entire content of this JSON key file.
     - On Linux/macOS, you can use the terminal: `cat /path/to/your-key-file.json | base64 -w 0` (the `-w 0` flag prevents line wrapping).
     - On Windows, you can use PowerShell: `[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes((Get-Content -Path "/path/to/your-key-file.json" -Raw)))`
     - Alternatively, use a trusted local Base64 encoding tool. Do not paste your key into untrusted online encoders.
  4. Add the resulting Base64 encoded string as `VERTEX_AI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_BASE64` in your repository's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.

### Enable Automatic PRs

1. **Enable GitHub Actions to Create PRs:** Some repositories may need to explicitly enable GitHub Actions to create pull requests. You can do this in your repository's Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions, and ensure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is checked.

### Push to main

Make a change to your source language file (e.g., `public/locales/en.json`) and push to your main branch. Locawise will automatically run, translate, and create a PR!

## Action Inputs

Here's a detailed breakdown of the inputs for locawise-action:

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| openai-api-key | Your OpenAI API key. Required if using OpenAI GPT models. | false | '' |
| vertex-ai-service-account-key-base64 | Your Google Cloud service account key (JSON content, Base64 encoded). Required if using Vertex AI models. Ensure the entire JSON content is Base64 encoded. | false | '' |
| source-lang-code | The language code of your primary (source) language file (e.g., en, de). | true | |
| file-name-pattern | The naming pattern for your language files. Use {language} as a placeholder for the language code (e.g., {language}.json, messages_{language}.properties). | true | |
| target-lang-codes | A comma-separated list of target language codes you want to translate into (e.g., es,fr,de,ja). | true | |
| localization-root-path | Path to the directory containing your language files, relative to the repository root (e.g., src/locales, i18n, public/locales). Defaults to the repository root if empty. | false | '' |
| context | Crucial for quality! Detailed instructions for the AI about your application's domain, purpose, target audience, and any specific stylistic requirements. Multi-line input is supported. | false | '' |
| glossary | Define specific terms and their exact required translations. Provide as a YAML formatted string (e.g., "term1: translation1\nterm2: translation2"). Multi-line input is supported. | false | '' |
| tone | A description of the desired tone for the translations (e.g., "Formal and professional", "Playful and witty", "Neutral"). | false | '' |
| llm-model | The specific LLM model name from the provider (e.g., gpt-4o, gemini-1.5-flash). If omitted, Locawise uses a default model from the selected provider. | false | '' |
| llm-location | The geographic location or region for the LLM API endpoint, this is required for Vertex AI (e.g., us-central1, europe-west1). | false | '' |

## Choosing Your LLM Provider

Locawise supports:

- **OpenAI**: Access to powerful models like GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo. Requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Google Vertex AI**: Access to efficient and capable models like Gemini (e.g., gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro). Requires a `VERTEX_AI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_BASE64` (the Base64 encoded JSON service account key).

You can provide secrets for the provider that you want to use.

## Supported File Formats

- ✅ `.json` (key-value, including nested objects; commonly used with `{language}.json` naming)
- ✅ `.properties` (Java properties files; commonly used with `messages_{language}.properties` naming)
- ✅ `.xml` (Android strings.xml files; commonly used with values-{language}/strings.xml)
- 🔜 More formats coming soon! The architecture is designed for easy expansion.
